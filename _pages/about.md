Thank you for visiting my website! My name is Justin Holt. I am an experienced help desk technician and manager, with experience in software development. Throughout these experiences, I have been the designated "documenter". Early in my career, I had always taken it upon myself to edit existing documents to improve their grammar, structure, and formatting. As an Application Support Specialist at a small startup company, I wore many hats - meaning my role consisted of a wide array of tasks. This is where I got an abundance of exposure to Technical Writing. I was responsible for being the company's ONLY L1 support technician, and one of two L2 support technicians. Additionally, I was tasked with re-writing and managing the company's Knowledge Base, hosted via the FreshService ticketing system. Lastly, I was tasked with writing up formal documentation in Jira for L3 and developers (a senior software engineer, an offshore junior software engineer, and a DevOps engineer). Through this experience, I have become familiar with all kinds of technical concepts and documentation, including but not limited to:
<ul>
  <li>Help Guides</li>
  <li>Software Manuals</li>
  <li>Troubleshooting Guides</li>
  <li>
    Software Documentation
    <ul>
      <li>Jira, Confluence, FreshService</li>
      <li>XML, REST API</li>
      <li>HTML/CSS, JavaScript</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Release Notes</li>
  <li>API Documentation</li>
  <li></li>
  <li></li>
</ul>

With a wide array of technical knowledge, and an inclination for verbal/written clarity as it relates to documentation, I am looking to kickstart my career and pursuing Technical Writing not only as a career, but as a passion. If I can help you or your company build, manage, or edit documentation, please reach out to me via email: justinsholt50@gmail.com. For some examples of articles I have written throughout my experience as a documentation specialist, please click Portfolio at the top of the page. To get a closer look at my previous experience and some tools and technologies I am familiar with, please click CV at the top of the page.

Thank you so much for taking the time to read my summary. Happy Writing!
